it is a project made with power BI, Excel, SQL

Power BI desktop version need to be installed before running this project

Once installed, you can simply load the data set provided in this repo or you can directly open the.PbiX file

I have created an interactive dashboard, showing the current trends of road accident analysis based on factors like region, urban versus rural, weather conditions, road surface conditions, monthly trends, yearly trends, severity of accident, Junction detail, and many more factors.

This project is divided mainly in four phases. First phase is to load the data set and clean it.

Second phase is to transform the data with the help of data modelling and power query editor data modelling is done to establish the relationship between the tables and to form many to one cardinality, such that there is a unique values in the new calendar table.

Next third phase consist of EDA where I explored, the trends. According to the data said there are more than three lakh entries.

At the last phase, I have summarised and made the interactive dashboard using power BI on the useful and important KPI, slicers, filters, and geospatial view of the road accident trends
